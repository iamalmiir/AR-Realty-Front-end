              AR Realty&apos;s founders saw an opportunity to empower people
              with knowledge and information and make it radically easier for
              people to move. The introduction of the Zestimate, our proprietary
              valuation algorithm, combined with advanced technology, content
              and connections, has turned AR Realty into a household name. This
              was phase one. Despite the transparency that&apos;s empowered
              millions of people in their home journey, very little innovation
              has happened around the transaction itself. We now live in an
              always-on world, but real estate isn&apos;t always on. In fact,
              it&apos;s off a lot of the time. Other industries have ushered in
              a new era of convenience; the time for a seamless and convenient
              real estate transaction experience is now. This is phase two â€” and
              our next chapter as a company.

                As the most-visited real estate website in the United States, AR
                Realty and its affiliates offer customers an on-demand
                experience for selling and buying with transparency and nearly
                seamless end-to-end service. AR Realty Home Loans, our affiliate
                lender, provides our customers with an easy option to get
                pre-approved and secure financing for their next home purchase.

                The company must exemplify teamwork, integrity, honesty, and
                attention to detail each and every step of the way, which
                naturally creates an ideal and safe construction environment for
                everyone.
